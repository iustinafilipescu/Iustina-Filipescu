        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>After my first year as a computer science student I wanted to do something useful during summer. I wanted to mix creativity with coding so I chose to start
          a Web Development course. After a few hours spent learning to make sites I became very interested in this area of programming so I'm still learning and trying to be better.</p>

        <h3>C/C++ & Object-Oriented Programming -> Game Dev</h3>
        <p>During highschool my computer science class was based on solving easy to medium level problems in C/C++ but once I got in University I learned other interesting things
          that I could do while programming in C++ making more complex and useful programs, so I was really into solving every lab problem for my OOP class. Now I'm using my C++ and OOP skills making some games using Unreal Enigne.</p>

        <h3>Data Stuctures & Algorithms </h3>
        <p>This was one of my first courses and also my favorite and I consider it the root of computer science and also a skill that any programmer should have (at least the basics of it).</p>
